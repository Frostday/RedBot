okay well, for question two. newlinechar  newlinechar Games are on Tuesdays or Wednesdays in the evening (talking like 9 eastern, or like 7 pacific if you're on that coast). newlinechar  newlinechar Practices are at a similar time, but the day depends on the captain.
I think men, women, and people of other gender identities all have various feelings about beards ranging from love to hate to annoyance to apathy. newlinechar  newlinechar This is why we avoid blanket statements, kiddos.
She's utterly fine.
What team was he apart of?
I hope these were unlimited plans. I'm all for people gaming the system, but not at the expense of someone else's by-the-minute plan.
Ah that should be fantastic! And yeah they're fascinating, I was really hoping for a virology dissertation title.        newlinechar Got one about antibiotic resistance and the spread of vancomycin resistant MRSA, so almost as interesting :D

Both are holidays where people are back in their home towns maybe? Or both are days where people want to be with someone and OP was that outlet. newlinechar

It's 2 mil. I was shocked as well, but yea, PBs are a lot easier to offer for now.
It's Adnan. Not adnaan. Hae was a known weed smoker and wouldn't have been trying it for the first time.  newlinechar  newlinechar I think Adnan would have copped to this rather than the first degree murder charge. 
The third GIF is hilarious; some kind of giddy hyperactive maniacs on stage! I don't know what they're on, but I don't feel safe! ( ò·ó© ò‚Äô)
I'm aware of the ingredients I just don't like the taste of it. I prefer straight whiskey or cheap vodka over Fireball. I just can't do it. I'm not a fan of cinnamon in the least, tardface. 
Franzen plays for detroit
I've never really considered you guys contenders. More like wannabes. Almost there, but so far away. KD will never win a ring in OKC. Wherever he goes after, he probably gets to the finals first year.
He'd probably eat like that with or without her. 
I had a feeling that was going to be the problem. Thank you for the help! How do exactly do you strip them? I feel like I've read about stripping diapers many times but nobody really says how they go about doing it.

Did you notice how SK specifically stated in her email that she wasn't trying to make him out as an archetype and then Jay specifically uses that word to describe what SK was doing to him?

I contacted CNN and asked them why they're not reporting on the suicide of Jay Ralko, which arguably was the 'fault' of the doctor who prescribed her testosterone even though it's contraindicated for people with emotional instability. http://www.cnn.com/feedback/tips/newstips.html
The normal price for this is like $350 for a new one. How is $30 off for a refurbished card a good deal?

Awwww!! So cute! The up and the cat look surprisingly good together!

Welcome to Reddit.
I saw this at Walmart yesterday. Wish i didn't give this up for 1$ store credit at EB games.  Imagine what it'll be worth in a few more years! 
Well there is professional gaming, but lets face it you have a better chance of winning the lotto than going pro in a video game.
Remember, once you're done this is over forever. I only spent 2.5 years in but that was the biggest shock for me when I was done. That chapter is closed and you can get the fuck as far away from every university as possible. 
It's pretty clear that's the only place Windhorst isn't stalking LeBron.
I've typed on reds, they don't feel that great. I mean that's my opinion, I just don't see the appeal. To be honest, browns and blues feel like boobs.

Yep
There are exchanges that have quality standards. The ones that don't should need to be pressured by the community to stop turning a blind eye to scams to make more profit. 
Gawd the two of you are sexy as fuck!  I'd love to see a vid of you fucking ;p

What would actually stop people from buying 'drinking' water and using it as 'petrol' water though? You couldn't tax it at all.

Why not just use large cargo containers? Keeps the UI cleaner as instead of 72 small cargo containers you have 2 larges and only 18 smalls in the middle.

I know! I don't know where I'm going to put everything either. My wife is getting impatient with my evert growing collection. newlinechar  newlinechar Happy cake day!
I'm surprised that it's legal to fire someone over any accusation.  It was my impression that the concept of 'innocent until proven guilty' was embedded in our constitution.

Troll's sister (her biological sister that she's had the previously rocky relationship with) actually works at a credit union. It's a LOT better than her previous job at a grocery store chain that pretty much abuses and bullies its employees, let me tell you.

Your matches are more entertaining then your comments though.   newlinechar Could have pulled it off better then just 'show me them titties' type of replies. 
When did I call myself a cat?
That scares me more than it should.  Maybe he is like the labor faery.  Or one of them.  Like the scary one that will find you in the middle of the night and take hold really really fast.
Kinda weird that all those posts of girls' progress pics get downvoted and called out in the comments, but this one shoots to the top and everyone is positive.
I liked the pence trade to the giants at first, Joseph was a top catching prospect, it's unfortunate he's been so injury prone.  Even with that said, for what we gave up we probably could have gotten more for pence
I can confirm that burning Needles Hall down is a successful scare tactic, it has worked for both myself and many others.
Oh my sweetness!  I have already made two orders from Dawn Eyes.  Received the first one,  all the samples!! And made a second order.  Can't wait to get it.  The colors are great and the prices are wonderful.

No, one of the high-ranking spiritual leaders had a vision that told him black people were okay.  Coincidentally, this was right around the crux of the Civil Rights movement.
But both the personal hotspot and the official hotspot are inside the building, so that doesn't help at all.
Absolutely. Calling themselves a human rights movement, and in the same breath calling all women potentially false rape accusers or money grubbing whores? Miraculous 
4 cats and 4 dogs, checking in. My mom had 10 cats. It's in my blood. If I could make a house full of secret passageways for the cats and little dogs, I'd be on top of it. This guy is awesome.
How dare you. Stop shaming male sexuality.
It's too dip the crust in at the end. Works best if it's garlic bread crust. newlinechar  newlinechar Sounds weird but it is oh so delicious.
Couldn't agree with you more on this. The infinite copper cartel is the best clone I've ever owned. As a matter of fact, I have a copper and a brass at the moment.

Okay, cool. I couldn't tell if you were doing some hardcore trolling there or not. 
Nah, it's of metaphor

Wouldn't going lower make you stand out? Like making a shadow in the static. Having to tune it...THAT would be sweet.
I'd suggest starting with the Horus Heresy books. You can branch out to Commissar Cain's books if you want after that, or Gaunt's Ghosts - the former being on the silly side.

The 'died because of shitty decision making' is also a lousy argument to make about getting shot in a crowd by an effectively random bullet trajectory. Like does he think karma made it hit the one person who was in any way at fault? That was luck.
